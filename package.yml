summary    : Mixed-Level, Mixed-Signal Circuit Simulator
description: |
    Ngspice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator. Its code is based on three open source software packages: Spice3f5, Cider1b1 and Xspice. It is the open source successor of these venerable packages. Many, many modifications, bug fixes and improvements have been added to the code, yielding a stable and reliable simulator. Therefore, besides being used as a standalone simulator, Ngspice has been incorporated into many projects.
